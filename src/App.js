// MoEngage Assignment

// Bewery Review System
// 1. Build a web application to search Brewery by City using Brewery APIs
// (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) and add reviews. This web app
// should have sign-up for new users and login for existing users.
// 2. When a user logs in, the home page should have a Brewery search option. This
// search option should be able to search by_city, by_name, and by_type (Read
// API docs to see what by_city, by_name, and by_type means).
// 3. The search result should display at least the following details per Brewery:
// a. Brewery name
// b. Brewery Address
// c. Phone number
// d. Web site URL
// e. Current rating (rating based on point no.4)
// f. State, City
// 4. When the user clicks on a Brewery, the new page should open with all possible
// Brewery information. The user should have the ability to add reviews for a
// Brewery, and this should be saved in a hosted database that you will host to
// complete this exercise. Whenever someone opens a brewery page, the reviews
// should also be shown on the brewery info page. You should be storing the new
// reviews given by the user in your database and show them in the info page when
// it opens.
// 5. The review should contain a rating from 1-5 and a description.

// The application should have the following pages
// 1. Login/Signup Page
// 2. Search Page
// 3. Brewery page, along with existing reviews pulled from the hosted database. And
// also a section to add a review.
// What to submit
// 1. Please send us the video of the working demo of the application. The video should be
// accessible to all the people who have the link.
// 2. Please send us the code. Please share the public GitHub code link.
// 3. Please show your database contents in the video.

// We'd prefer this hosted on any free hosting server instead of localhost. You can choose
// any stack you are comfortable with to complete the assignment.
